# Gunshot-Detection-and-Location-System-GDLS

Background:

The military has decided to design and deploy a new gunshot detection and location system. Mobile units must be designed for inclusion into the equipment of each soldier on the battlefield.

Components:

Microphone, amplifier, and A/D 
Microprocessor
Power supplies â€“ the equipment provides 24VDC for your use 
GPS with RS232 serial NMEA stream and 1PPS digital signal
Low bandwidth wireless connection to command/control center via Ethernet interface

Functional Behavior:

This device must:
Listen to the ambient environment.
Detect gunfire noise.
Capture the precise GPS time and location of the unit when the gunshot occurred.
Provide this information to command/control, where data from multiple units will be aggregated to triangulate the enemy's position.

Assignment:

*Provide a high-level software design for the unit (e.g. functional block diagram.)  Put as much detail as is necessary for us to understand your design.
*Provide a set of testable requirements for the mobile unit (include requirements for software, as well.)
*Provide a set of tests that verify and validate that all requirements are met.
